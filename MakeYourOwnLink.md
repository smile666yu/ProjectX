### Making links via freeDNS
1. Go to https://freedns.afraid.org/, if it's blocked, try this on another device (you can't put the site through an unblocker, it won't work.)
2. This is probably your first time, so click "Sign Up for Free." If you already have an account, go to step 5.
3. Fill out all of the information in the boxes.
	> For your first and last name, you don't have to put your real name.
	
	> For the user ID,  you can put anything, make sure it's unique.
	
	> For your email, you could use a temporary email provider like [TempMail](https://temp-mail.org/) so you can create more links in the future.
	
4. Press sign-up after filling the boxes, and complete the email activation.
5. After making an account, now we are going to register the link. Go to this page in freeDNS: https://freedns.afraid.org/domain/registry
	> Alternatively, press "Subdomains" on the left side of the page, then "Add subdomain", then on the "Domain" box click on the dropdown, then click "many, many more." After that click "Shared Domain Registry" on the first sentence.

6. Click a domain link that you would like to use. (e.g. chickenkiller.com)
	> Make sure to select a domain that is unblocked for you. Domains that have a low popularity are probably unblocked. <br>
	> Also make sure that the domain is public.
7. In the configurations page, on the top make sure "A" record type is selected (it should be already).
8. Enter the name of the subdomain, it can be anything. (subdomainName.chosenDomain.com)
9. For the destination, it depends on what unblocker you want to use. You can try to googling it or joining discord servers, here is a helpful table I created:

| Unblocker   |  Type | IP Destination |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------- |
| Abyss     | Web browser|`5.161.43.35`     |
| Astroid   | Games, Unblocker, Emulators, Apps|`5.161.68.227`        |
| Artclass | Unblocker, Games, Apps |`193.26.115.218`|
| Shadow | Web Browser | `104.243.38.18`|
| Kitty Cat | Proxy, games, apps | `66.94.122.218` |
| Kazwire |  Proxy, games, apps | `209.222.97.244` |
| Plexile Arcade | Proxy, games, apps | `216.24.57.1` |
| Doge Unblocker | Proxy, games, apps | `38.175.196.242`|
| Interstellar | Proxy, games, apps | `5.161.66.1`|
| Rammerhead | Web Browser | `108.181.32.77`|
| Phantom Games | tons of games |`109.122.46.55`|
| *May or may not work:* Selenite | tons of games | `5.161.118.69`|
| *May or may not work:* Tinf0il | Proxy, games, apsp | `129.213.65.72`|
| Other unblockers have specific tutorials in their discord servers. To find their discord server, go to the [Proxy Discord Servers section](https://github.com/wea-f/ByePassHub/blob/main/mainUnblockers.md#caution-many-of-these-servers-will-ban-you-for-leaking-leaks-publicly-use-it-for-private-use-only) in the main Unblockers file.  

10. After putting the IP destination to your subdomain, press "save." Complete the captcha. 
11. Wait a couple minutes for your site to register and go to the link you created!
12. OPTIONAL: If you want, you can donate your created, working link in this [form](https://forms.gle/FaHsGQxFTnZ6uSvn9)! I will put the link in the mainUnblockers.md file, this will be highly appreciated!

### Make links with Vercel
Link: https://vercel.com/new/clone?repositoryurl=`ReplaceThisWithRepositoryURL`
1. Replace the filler with an unblocker repository. For example, vercel.com/new/clone?repositoryurl=https://github.com/dogenetwork/v4 for deploying a doge unblocker link. Here's more (you can find your own too):
	> Interstellar: `https://github.com/InterstellarNetwork/Interstellar` <br>
 	> Snorlax's Cave: `https://github.com/Snorlaxs-Cave/Snorlaxs-Cave-v2` <br>
 	> Artclass: `https://github.com/art-class/v4` <br>
 	> Utopia: `https://github.com/UtopiaUnblocker/Utopia` <br>
    	> Abyss Web: `https://github.com/AbyssServices/Abyss-Web` <br>
 	> Astroid: `https://github.com/VyperGroup/astroidv3` <br>
 	> Shuttle: `https://github.com/shuttlenetwork/shuttle` <br>
 	> Tinf0il: `https://github.com/Aluminum-Depot/Tinf0il-new` <br>
     	> Shadow Tabbed: `https://github.com/xnightless/Shadownetwork` <br>
2. Log in to your vercel account with Github, sign up if needed with Github (you will have to authorize).
3. In the "Create Git Repository," enter the repository name that will be linked to your unblocker, it can be anything.
4. Click "Create"
5. After a few moments, go to the link that you just created, which should be (repositoryName).vercel.app

### Make links with Cyclic
1. Go to `app.cyclic.sh/`
2. Login with Github, sign up with github if you don't have an account.
3. Link: app.cyclic.sh/api/app/deploy/`repositorynamefiller`
4. The repository name filler should be replaced with one of the following of your choice (you can find your own too):
	> Interstellar: `InterstellarNetwork/Interstellar` <br>
 	> Snorlax's Cave: `Snorlaxs-Cave/Snorlaxs-Cave-v2` <br>
 	> Artclass: `art-class/v4` <br>
 	> Utopia: `UtopiaUnblocker/Utopia` <br>
    	> Abyss Web: `AbyssServices/Abyss-Web` <br>
 	> Astroid: `VyperGroup/astroidv3` <br>
 	> Shuttle: `shuttlenetwork/shuttle` <br>
 	> Tinf0il: `Aluminum-Depot/Tinf0il-new` <br>
  	> Doge Unblocker: `dogenetwork/v4` <br>
      	> Shadow Tabbed: `https://github.com/xnightless/Shadownetwork` <br>
5. Example: app.cyclic.sh/api/app/deploy/shuttlenetwork/shuttle for a shuttle deployment, go to that link.
6. Follow the instructions on the webpage, if it has an error, "Unathorized," make sure to sign in with github on step 1.
7. Press "Connect", and you will need to confirm it with github.
8. Continue following the directions, it's pretty straightforward, and the deployed link will be at the bottom once you finish!

### Make links with Render
(coming soon!)
IGNORE ALL OF THIS, Doesn't WORK.... <br>
Link: https://render.com/deploy?repo=(repositoryURL)
1. With the above link, substitute the repositoryURL with one of the below (you can find your own too):
 	> Interstellar: `https://github.com/InterstellarNetwork/Interstellar` <br>
 	> Snorlax's Cave: `https://github.com/Snorlaxs-Cave/Snorlaxs-Cave-v2` <br>
 	> Artclass: `https://github.com/art-class/v4` <br>
 	> Utopia: `https://github.com/UtopiaUnblocker/Utopia` <br>
    	> Abyss Web: `https://github.com/AbyssServices/Abyss-Web` <br>
 	> Astroid: `https://github.com/VyperGroup/astroidv3` <br>
 	> Shuttle: `https://github.com/shuttlenetwork/shuttle` <br>
 	> Tinf0il: `https://github.com/Aluminum-Depot/Tinf0il-new` <br>
  	> Doge Unblocker: `https://github.com/dogenetwork/v4` <br>
   	> Shadow Tabbed: `https://github.com/xnightless/Shadownetwork` <br>
2. Example: https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/Shadowproxynetwork/Shadownetwork
3. It will prompt you to sign in, sign up if needed. You should sign in/sign up with Github.
4. For the blueprint name, put anything
5. For the branch, keep it at `main`
